creating of profile starts with finding a client that will be primary owner of the profile 
(done implictly when launced from client screen)

User will select type of the profile (servicing or online)

Next is the selection of the accounts - user can select option to enroll all accounts for the client or select specific accounts.

In additon user can add additional secondary clients (pop-up search by client number or client name)
and decide to enroll all accounts or specific accounts to the profile.


All of this should be done in a single command.
